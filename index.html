            I joined and participated in a JUMP program recently. 
            I spent 3 months of hyper-intense training talent creation program where top STEM talent are hand-picked from across the US. 
            Those selected then greatly accelerate their learning curves via technical training programs that give them the equivalent of 12-18 months of industry experience.
